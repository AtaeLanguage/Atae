# General File/Folder Structure
____


## Folders
To make everything understandable, the general file structure should be as so:

```
├── English  
│   └── Electronic  
│       ├── Ambient    
│       ├── Breakbeat  
│       ├── Dubstep  
│       ├── Garage  
│       ├── Hardstyle  
│       ├── House  
│       ├── Techno  
│       └── Trance
```
Above is a sample English structure with a main genre of Electronic, followed by eight sub-genres. Please note, sub-genres are folders. Sub-genre folders include a single Markdown file containing all artists of specified genre.

## Files

Categorized by added-date, artists of a sub-genre are not alphabetized in their parent Markdown files. This is to make longterm editing easier.

The general file structure should be as so:

| Artist       | Link    |
|--------------|:---------:|
| Monsieur Nov | YouTube |
| Jewel        | YouTube |
| MHD          | YouTube |
| Jok'air      | YouTube |
| Dehmo        | YouTube |

Above is a French sample structure with a main genre of Hip Hop and a sub-genre of Rap.

Links can be anything **directly** relating to the artists music.
*For example, a YouTube link to one of their popular songs.*
